# ü©∏ CV Slayer üòà ‚Äî Brutally Honest Resume Roaster

CV Slayer is not your typical resume reviewer. It's the dark-humored, brutally honest, slightly unhinged HR you never wanted to meet... but probably needed to. Choose how hard you want to get roasted ‚Äî from ‚ÄúPyar Se üíò‚Äù to ‚ÄúDhang Se üò°‚Äù ‚Äî and watch your resume get shredded with style (and swears üò¨).

> It uses AI-generated sarcasm, satire, and roasts.  
> Don't take it to heart ‚Äî take it as motivation.

again i am telling, lets go every pages one by one, check if there any cruticial data is not leaking in network tab, console.log, fix these, make production ready, no test, improve mobile view ui, and also make correct for mongodb that all the data properly store and fetch on admin panel, donot need to make super good, just working with this points and if any other point you think need to fix. okay?? we are going again one by one every page, we donot have whole day, just say it good or not and move forward if not good then with updated code


1. db is not working, not storing data and fetching on admin panel
2. make better ui of admin panel
3. better ui of navbar, that toogle button
4. use env file instead of directly coded email and other important data
5. fix linting, npm run build issue, remove console.log and other sesitive data leaking
instaed of localhost or development, make it for production
6. make it mobile responsive
